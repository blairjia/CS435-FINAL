# CS435-FINAL
Water Flow Sensor Project for Embedded Systems
Blair Jia and Zayn Makdessi - Fall 2021

# Introduction

This project is a culmination of all of the hardware based material we have learned in the course, as well as the important ethical discussions about implementing systems. When we first started brainstorming for this project, we originally had some ideas on implementing a sensor system for older vehicles, but we quickly realized the importance of promoting greener systems as the next generation of computer scientists. We therefore decided to implement a water flow sensor, to help promote the saving of water, the most important resource on this planet. Our project allows users to monitor their water usage of certain faucets, taps, hoses, or small pipes, displaying the amount of water used. For the forgetful, if a tap is left on for too long, a buzzer warns them about their water usage, reminding them of the importance of saving water.

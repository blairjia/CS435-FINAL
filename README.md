# CS435-FINAL
Water Flow Sensor Project for Embedded Systems
Blair Jia and Zayn Makdessi - Fall 2021

## Introduction

Introduction section. In this section you should provide a general introduction to your project (what is that you are trying to accomplish - goal), place it in the context of the course, and explain why you chose this particular project (motivation). In the introduction, you should also cite the sources that you consulted during the research and development phase of your project (the list will go at the end in the references section).

This project is a culmination of all of the hardware based material we have learned in the course, as well as the important ethical discussions about implementing systems. When we first started brainstorming for this project, we originally had some ideas on implementing a sensor system for older vehicles, but we quickly realized the importance of promoting greener systems as the next generation of computer scientists. We therefore decided to implement a water flow tracker, to help promote the saving of water, the most important resource on this planet. Using the ESP32 Feather microcontroller, a buzzer, a flow sensor, as well as some data analytics, we have implemented a small and budget friendly system for everybody.

Our project allows users to monitor their water usage of certain faucets, taps, hoses, or small pipes, displaying the amount of water used. For the forgetful, if a tap is left on for too long, a buzzer warns them about their water usage, reminding them of the importance of saving water. The internet savy will also be able to go online, and find visualizations of their water usage, to see their trends.

This section should be used to described how you accomplished your goals! Here you can describe the devices/peripherals/libraries that you used. If you used existing projects as inspiration or building blocks (cite them!), include in this section a description about how you incorporated these projects, what existing code you used and what you added/modified, and clearly identify how your project differs from an existing one.
